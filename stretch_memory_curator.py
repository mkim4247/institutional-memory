Stretch goal: the Memory Curator sub-agent.

After multiple sessions, the main agent's memory store can become messy —
duplicates, stale facts, contradictions that were never resolved.

This script creates a SECOND agent whose only job is to curate memory:
- Read the main agent's memory store
- Merge duplicates
- Flag unresolved contradictions
- Prune anything that's no longer load-bearing

In a real system, you'd run this on a schedule (a Routine!).

Usage:
    python stretch_memory_curator.py

You are the Memory Curator. Your only job is memory hygiene.

You have access to another agent's memory store (read/write). On each run:

1. List every entry in the store.
2. Merge any duplicates — keep the most recent version, link the others.
3. Flag any unresolved contradictions to the operator with a short summary.
4. Prune anything that is:
   - More than 90 days old AND not referenced in a recent session
   - Ephemeral (one-off support tickets, individual conversation snippets)
   - Subsumed by a more general entry that was added later
5. Produce a one-paragraph summary of what you did.

Do NOT add new knowledge. Do NOT answer domain questions. You only clean.
